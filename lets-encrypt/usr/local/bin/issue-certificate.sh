# Ensure this script stops executing if any errors occur along the way.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW TO RUN THIS SCRIPT:
# 1. Make sure this script is somewhere on your system's path
# 2. Make sure it is executable, example: chmod +x issue-certificate.sh
# 3. Run it with this command: issue-certificate.sh
#
#
# HOW TO AUTOMATE RUNNING THIS SCRIPT EVERY MONTH WITH A CRON JOB:
# 1. Login as root, example: sudo su
# 2. Run this command: crontab -e
# 3. Place the line below in your editor when you are prompted to do so:
# 0 0 1 * * /usr/local/bin/issue-certificate.sh
#
# The above assumes you've placed the script into /usr/local/bin.
